# People capacity tracker
This repository is a code for an application used to detect and monitor a room capacity.

## Introduction
The algorithm is based on a CUDA (or Compute Unified Device Architecture) impelmentation, which is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) that allows software to use certain types of graphics processing unit (GPU) for general purpose processing.
The tracking system is based heavily on ***SORT***, which is realtime tracking algorithm for 2D multiple object tracking in video sequences

## Hardware Requirements:
1. Jetson nano 4g b01
2. Pi camera v2 (but any other camera compatible with the jetson Nano would also work fine)
