# People capacity tracker
This repository is a code for an application used to detect and monitor a room capacity.

The algorithm is based on a CUDA (or Compute Unified Device Architecture) impelmentation, which is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) that allows software to use certain types of graphics processing unit (GPU) for general purpose processing.

## Hardware Requirements:
1. jetson nano 4g b01
2. Pi camera v2 (but any other camera compatible with the jetson Nano would also work fine)

# Use
